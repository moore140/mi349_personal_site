    <h1>Hello, I'm Jordan Moore!</h1>

    <p>I'm a 3rd year student at MSU, and I'm majoring in MI with a focus on game design. 
    After these summer courses, I will have enough credits to graduate, although I'm not 
    exactly sure what I want to do next yet, especially due to the coronavirus.</p>
